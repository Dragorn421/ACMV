# ACMV
Advanced Champion Mastery Viewer - A LoL-themed website showing masteries of summoners  

Here is the [live web page](http://brallos.tk/lol/acmv/) (remember this still is work in progress)  

I'm making use of [Rome](https://github.com/bevacqua/rome).

## How to setup
### Modify files
You need an API key provided by Riot Games and an access to a database.  
Use these to complete the base.php file in the include directory.  

### Forbid access to include directory
The include directory should not be accessible by a visitor. Depending on the web server you may use a .htaccess or something else.  
I use Apache2 and I put in the virtual host file this (replace "/path to acmv root" with the right path of course):  
```
<Directory /path to acmv root/include/>
    Order deny,allow
    deny from all
</Directory>
```

### Database setup
I mentioned the use of a database. This database should contain a table like this one, named `lolmasteries`:

|Column   |Type        |Null|Default|Comment                            |
|---------|------------|----|-------|-----------------------------------|
|id       |int(11)     |No  |None   |Primary key, index, auto increment |
|name     |varchar(100)|No  |None   |Collate: utf8_bin                  |
|region   |varchar(10) |No  |None   |Collate: utf8_bin                  |
|masteries|text        |No  |None   |Collate: utf8_bin                  |
|time     |int(11)     |No  |None   |                                   |

**It is highly recommended to create a unique constraint for the couple (`name`, `region`):**  
`ALTER TABLE lolmasteries ADD UNIQUE (name,region)`  
The `id` column is not needed for the whole thing to work but is definitely recommended for speed purposes.

### Soon: CRON setup
Not using CRON at the moment, will be coming.
